Files 4 i.e. exogenousdelay.cc corresponds to simulating the problem statment.
To run this : place this file(exogenousdelay.cc) in ns-3-dev/scratch and exogenous.sh in ns-3-dev/.
/ns-3-dev$ chmod +x exogenous.sh
/ns-3-dev$ ./exogenous.sh
Outputs corresponding to two different cases are produced on terminal. These are clearly explained in report.

Now to run our implementation. Place files 1,2,3 in ns-3-dev/src/lte/model. Basically replace the exisitng files with new files provided.
To run : ./waf --run "exogenousdelay.cc"
This produces a output where only 1 packet is received. This explained in the report.

Since our implementation is not complete, we cannot compare the improvement in effect on exogenous delay of URLLC traffic because of eMBB.
